Welcome to a new blog post. In this blog, we will create a semantic search engine for any docs repository on Github using Upstash Vector.

## What is Semantic Search?
Semantic search basically means "searching with meaning". In a simple search, we take the user input and look for it in the database. When we do this returning a result that contains the word "soccer" instead of "football" is not very likely but while creating a search engine this is what we want to achieve.

Semantic search helps us with this issue. In semantic search, search domain is kept in the database as embeddings which are multi-dimensional vectors that are created considering the relations of words. In this approach, search queries are turned into embeddings too. So, returning "soccer" when the query is "football" becomes possible.

## Project Description
The project will be implemented on Next.js using Javascript (jsx for frontend, js for backend). Since this is a tutorial UI design will be kept very simple. Tools that will be used are Github API, Langchain, OpenAI Embeddings and Upstash Vector. Github repo of the project is [here](https://github.com/kaanguneyli/semantic_search_for_docs), also you can deploy the project to your Vercel account using the button on the Readme file of the project.

## Get Started

### Create a Next.js Application
To create a new project, first direct to the directory that you want to create your project in using your terminal. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g create-next-app
npx create-next-app@latest
```

When prompted choose a name for your project and pick `Yes` for the options:
- Use Tailwind CSS (for UI design)
- Use "App Router"

After this step, go to your project's folder with the `cd` command and install the necessary libraries

```bash
npm install @octokit/core
npm install -S langchain
npm install -S @upstash/vector
```

From now on, when you are at the directory of your project the command

```bash
npm run dev
```

is going to be sufficient to run the project on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

If you need further clarification, you can refer to the [Readme](https://github.com/kaanguneyli/semantic_search_for_docs) or the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app)
___
### Set up Upstash Vector
Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/login) and create an account if you don't have already. Then, login to your account and go to Vector using the bar at the top of the page. After that click `Create Index`.

![create-index](../../public/blog/semantic-search-for-docs/create-index.png) 

Then pick a name for your database as you like and choose the appropriate options for your location and embedding model. Since we are using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` in this tutorial, we picked `1536` as dimension and `COSINE` as metric. If you are using any other model, you have to check the documentation see which values you have to choose.

![index-specifics](../../public/blog/semantic-search-for-docs/index-specifics.png)

Then pick your plan as you like and click `Create`.

![choose-plan](../../public/blog/semantic-search-for-docs/choose-plan.png)

Your database is ready for you.

![details](../../public/blog/semantic-search-for-docs/details.png)
___
### Create the environment variables
Now create a file called `.env` in your project and add it to the `.gitignore` file if you are considering to add this project to your Github account. In this file, we will store our API keys. To get your Upstash Vector keys go to the database you created, go to the tab `details` and copy the content under `.env` tab as in the image

![connect_env](../../public/blog/semantic-search-for-docs/connect_env.png) 

You also need an OpenAI API key for the project. Once you add it too, your `.env` file should look like this
```bash
# .env

UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="..."
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="..."
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```
Now, you ready to start the implementation.

## Implementation
Most of our code will be under the `app` directory since we have chosen to use the app router when we were creating the project.
We need to implement these 3 properties:
- Read the repository and create chunks (`app/components/ParseRepo.jsx`)
- Create an API endpoint that upserts the documents to Upstash Vector (`app/api/addDocuments/route.js`)
- Create an API endpoint that searches queries (`app/api/search/route.js`)

### Create the User Interface

Firstly, we need to take the owner name and repo name of the target repository from the user. So, we need two forms and one submit button. These two forms have to assign their values to some variables, therefore we need to use the `useState` function. We also want to disable the submit button when a submit is getting processed. This job is dependent on user input too. So, we need to use `useState` again. 

We also have to specify that what our program has to do when the user gives input. So, we have to implement `handleInputChange` and `handleSubmit` functions. These functions will update the values of our two important variables. `handleSubmit` will also send the input to our parser script which will be implemented shortly.

Code below is our implementation that covers all these properties. 

```jsx
// app/page.jsx

'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { parseMarkdowns } from '@/components/ParseRepo';

const Home = () => {

  // create variables that will be set based on the input
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState({owner: '', repo: ''});

  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setInputText((prevState) => ({
      ...prevState,
      [name]: value
    }));
  };

    // when the input is submitted run the parser script
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setSubmitting(true);
    const res = await parseMarkdowns(inputText.owner, inputText.repo);
    setSubmitting(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          <span>Owner: </span>
          <input
            type="text"
            name="owner"
            value={inputText.owner}
            onChange={handleInputChange}
            placeholder='Owner name'
            required
          />
        </label>
      </form>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          <span>Repo: </span>
          <input
            type="text"
            name="repo"
            value={inputText.repo}
            onChange={handleInputChange}
            placeholder='Repo name'
            required
          />
        </label>
        <button
          type='submit'
          disabled={submitting}
        >
          {submitting ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
        </button>
        <div>
          {submitting && (
            <div>You submitted: {inputText.owner} / {inputText.repo}</div>
          )}
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```


The code above returns the user interface but it does not get shown to the user yet. This is because Next.js shows the `layout.jsx` file to the user. So, we have to create and implement it too. Also, we have to add our web application's metadata to that file.

We will create the file in a way that it creates a very simple layout for its children files. (one page in our case) This approach is very useful while creating dynamic pages.


```jsx
// app/layout.jsx

export const metadata = {
  title: "semantic search engine for docs",
  description: "semantic search engine for docs"
}


const RootLayout = ( {children} ) => {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <body>
        <div className='main'></div>
        <main className='app'>
          {children}
        </main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

export default RootLayout;
```
___
### Parse The Repo
This part is about creating the ``parseMarkdown`` function which was referred in the first part as the parser script. More specifically, we will implement the following properties:
- Access the repo
- Extract the files with extenisons `.md` or `.mdx`
- Create smaller chunks from the files
- `POST` the chunks to API

To access the repo we need to use the Github API and to create the chunks we need some libraries from Langchain. Let's start with adding these imports and creating the objects

```jsx
// components/ParseRepo.jsx

import { Octokit } from "@octokit/core";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { Document } from "langchain/document";

const octokit = new Octokit();  // Github API client

const splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("markdown", {
  chunkSize: 500,  // You can change this according to your needs
  chunkOverlap: 0,   // You can change this according to your needs
});


const parseMarkdowns = async (owner, repo, path = '') => {
  // we will fill this part in this section
};
  
export { parseMarkdowns };
```

While implementing the ``parseMarkdown`` function, we will follow a recursive approach. Each call of the function will handle a different directory. The function will hold the two lists which hold the markdown files and directories that are located in the current directory.

Markdown files will be read using the Github API and then they will be converted to ``Document`` objects from Langchain library. Converting the files to document makes us able to add metadata to them. Thanks to that while searching we won't have to look for the resulting query in the files again, we can immediately return the file name too. 

Then, we have to implement a for loop that calls the `parseMarkdown` for each directory we have found. So, we reach not only the markdowns that are in the master directory, but the ones that take place under the subdirectories.

Finally, we split the documents we have just created using Langchain's document splitter and create a `POST` request that sends the output of this function to our endpoint which we are going to create after this section. This part will also be called in every recursive call in order to lower the number of documents posted in one call.

```jsx

  try {
    // Access the directory using GitHub API
    const response = await octokit.request('GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}', {
      owner,
      repo,
      path,
    });
    const files = response.data;

    // Filter out the Markdown files
    const markdowns = files.filter(file => {
      return file.type === 'file' && (file.name.endsWith('.md') || file.name.endsWith('.mdx'));
    });

    // Filter out the directories
    const directories = files.filter(file => file.type === 'dir');

    // Get the contents of the Markdown files
    const contents = await Promise.all(markdowns.map(async (file) => {
      const fileResponse = await octokit.request('GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}', {
        owner,
        repo,
        path: file.path,
      });

      // Decode the content from base64
      const content = Buffer.from(fileResponse.data.content, 'base64').toString('utf-8');

      // Create a Document object using the content from the Markdown file
      const document = new Document({ metadata: {name: file.path}, pageContent: content });
      return document;
      
    }));

    // Recursively search subdirectories for Markdown files
    for (const directory of directories) {
      await parseMarkdowns(owner, repo, directory.path);
    }

    // Split the documents into chunks and post them to the api
    let output = [];
    output = await splitter.splitDocuments(contents);
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/addDocument', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(output),
      });
      return JSON.stringify(response);
      
    } catch (error) { 
      console.error("Error in POST:", error);
      return output;
    }

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in GET:", error);
    return [];
  }

```

### Add Documents to Upstash Vector

In this step, we will start to create the first API endpoint, that upserts the chunks we have just created to our Upstash Vector database. To complete this task, what we have to do is the following:
- Receive the `POST` request
- Create the index
- Create the embeddings
- Create the Upstash Vector store object
- Add the embeddings to database
- Return response

To create the endpoint, we have to create a folder called `api` and create a folder that names our endpoint inside. In our case this folder's name will be `addDocuments`. For implementation of endpoints Next.js requires the file's name to be `route.js`.( `.js` part can change according to language.) 

To start our implementation, we have to specify the necessary libraries and create a function that handles the `POST` request and it should look like this. Also, we have to receive the message that was sent from the frontend. We can add the successful and unsuccesful responses too.

```js
// app/api/addDocuments/route.js

import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { UpstashVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/upstash";

export async function POST (req) {
  // Get the data from the request
  const data = await req.json();
  try {

    // we will fill this part in this section

    return new Response(JSON.stringify('Successful'), {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      status: 200,
    });
  }
  catch (error) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }), {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      status: 500,
    });
  }
}
```

Now, we have to create our Upstash Vector Index object and OpenAI Embeddings objects. To create the OpenAI Embeddings we will use the library from Langchain. These objects require our API keys as arguments. We have added them to environment variables before, so we can specify them like below. Also, to use OpenAI Embeddings, we have to specify an embedding model. Previously, we have mentioned that  we will use the `text-embedding-3-small` model, so we add it too.

```js
    // Create an Index object
    const index = new Index({
      url: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL,
      token: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN,
    });
    
    // Create an OpenAIEmbeddings object
    const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
      openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      modelName: "text-embedding-3-small",
    });
```

We have created the necessary objects, now we have to create the embeddings and add them to our database. To do this, we will use the `UpstashVectorStore` object from Langchain.

```js
    // Create a VectorStore object
    const vectorStore = new UpstashVectorStore(embeddings, { index });

    // Add the documents to the VectorStore
    await vectorStore.addDocuments(data);
```

From now on, when a user submits an input, it will be parsed and upserted to the vector database. If you like, you can check whether the operation is successful or not from the `Logs` tab in Vercel or you can simply go to your relevant vector database on `Upstash Console` and check the `Data Browser` tab. Your documents will be visible there if the upsert is successful.
___
### Search Queries

Finally, we have to create the enpoint of searching. This time, we will create a folder called `search` under `api` and create the `route.js` file again.

This time we will handle `GET` request because search will receive its queries from the URL. For example if the project is running on local `http://localhost:3000/api/search?query=computer` will search the query `computer`. (In this example the `prompt` variable we will declare in this section is assigned to the string `query`.)

Things we have implement in this part are as follows:
- Receive query from URL
- Create the index, embedding and vector store objects
- Search the query
- Return responses

Just like the previous part, we will start the implementation by specifying the imports and responses. This time we will also create the URL object and initialize the necessary variables.

```js
import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { UpstashVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/upstash"; 

export async function GET(req) {
    // Parse the query from the URL
    const url = new URL(req.url);

    // Set the number of results to return
    const topK = 3;

    // Set the input prompt
    const prompt = 'query';
    
    try {

        // we will fill this part in this section

        return new Response(response, {
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            status: 200,
        });
    } catch (error) {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }), {
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            status: 500,
        });
    }
  }
```

We have to read the input using the URL object, in order to read the input we have to create a URLSearchParams object and get the input with it. 

```js
        // Get the query from the URL 
        const searchParam = new URLSearchParams(url.searchParams);
        const query = searchParam.get(prompt);
```

Recall we have created index, embeddings and vector store objects in `addDocuments`. We have to create them here too in order to be able to reach our database and embed the query.

```js
        // Create a new Index object
        const index = new Index({
            url: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL,
            token: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN,
        });
        
        // Create a new OpenAIEmbeddings object
        const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
            openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
            modelName: "text-embedding-3-small",
        });

        // Create a new UpstashVectorStore object
        const vectorStore = new UpstashVectorStore(embeddings, { index });
```

Now, we are ready to search the query. The `topK` variable we have specified at the beginning helps us here. Since we have selected it as 3, we will see the best 3 results. You can choose it as you like. 

```js
        // Perform a similarity search with the query
        const result = await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore(
            query,
            topK
          );
```

Finally, we have to create the response to able to return our results to the user. Creating an 2-dimensional array and keeping the content and page names each of these arrays would be a simple and useful approach here. We have added some empty lines for cosmetic reasons.

```js
        let response = [];
        result.forEach((element) => {
            const res_one = [element[0].pageContent, element[0].metadata.name, '\n\n\n'];
            response.push(res_one);
        });
```

With that, we complete the implementation.
