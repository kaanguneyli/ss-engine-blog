Welcome to a new blog post. In this blog we will create a semantic search engine for docs the repositories on Github using Upstash Vector.

## What is Semantic Search?
Semantic search basically means "searching with meaning". In a very simple search, we take the user input and look for it in out database. When we do this
returning a result that contains the word "soccer" instead of "football" is not very likely but while creating a search engine this is what we want to achieve.
Semantic search helps us with this issue. In semantic search, search domain is kept in the database as embeddings which are multi-dimensional vectors that are 
created considering the relations of words. In this approach, search queries are turned into embeddings too. So, returning "soccer" when the query is "football"
becomes possible.

## Project Description
The project will be implemented on Next.js using Jsxx for front-end and Javascript for back-end. Since this is a tutorial UI design is very simple. Tools that
will be used are Github API, Langchain, OpenAI Embeddings and Upstash Vector. Github repo of the project is
[here](https://github.com/kaanguneyli/semantic_search_for_docs), also you can deploy the project on Vercel using the button on the Readme file of the project.
